# Considerations
- Each Tool is modular
- Tools: Company data sources, Web Search, Discord search

# Tools
Query Data Sources: query company data sources such as Docs
Query Web Search: LLM makes a search to Google, Bing, etc.
Query Discord: Search through Discord messages and channels for Tribal Knowledge

# Docs ingestion
1. Sitemap -> Get all URLs from sitemap
2. Fetch URL -> Get HTML content of URL
3. Create a Deeplake dataset for querying


# First query
1. Query comes in
2. Query is sanitized for PII data?
3. Query hits Query Data Sources Tool
4. Answer is generated w/ 3.5-turbo
5. Answer + sources are passed to gpt-4; does this answer the query?
6. If YES, return answer and sources
7. If NO, initiate Agent workflow

# Agent + Orchestrator workflow
1. The response is provided + a reason from gpt-4 why it didn't pass it
2. This is passed to an Orchestrator who is prompted with it's task + Tools it has available
3.
